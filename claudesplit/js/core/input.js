// Input Handling

// This file is intentionally left mostly empty as the input handling functionality
// has been moved to more appropriate files:
// - Player movement inputs are in movement.js (onKeyDown, onKeyUp)
// - UI inputs are handled in ui.js (setupSettingsScreen, handleInventoryClick)

// The file is maintained for architectural clarity and future expansion
// of input handling systems (e.g., gamepad support, custom keybindings).
