Based on the code you've shared, the distant haze/mist effect and the color settings for the game's environment are implemented in the worldgen.js file, specifically within the updateDayNightLighting function.
<BR>

The mist effect is created using THREE.js fog, which gives that hazy distant appearance. Here's the relevant code that creates this effect:
javascriptCopy// Update fog to match sky color and time of day

<BR>

if (!scene.fog) {<BR>
    scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(skyColor, cameraDistance * 1.5, cameraDistance * 5);
<BR>
} else {
<BR>
    scene.fog.color.copy(skyColor);
<BR>
    scene.fog.near = cameraDistance * (1.0 + intensity); // Fog closer at night
<BR>
    scene.fog.far = cameraDistance * (4.0 + intensity * 2); // Fog less dense during day
<BR>
}
<BR>

<BR>

The fog color automatically matches the sky color, and both change based on the time of day. The distance at which fog starts appearing (near) and the distance at which objects are completely obscured by fog (far) vary with the day/night cycle.

<BR>
As for the colors, they're also defined in the updateDayNightLighting function:
javascriptCopy// Define colors for different times of day

<BR>
const nightColor = new THREE.Color(0x050515); // Dark blue night
<BR>
const dayColor = new THREE.Color(0x87CEEB);   // Sky blue day

<BR>
const dawnColor = new THREE.Color(0xffa500);  // Orange sunrise/sunset

<BR>
The game smoothly transitions between these colors based on the time of day:

<BR>

During daytime: Sky blue (0x87CEEB)

<BR>
During sunrise/sunset: Orange (0xffa500)
<BR>

During nighttime: Dark blue (0x050515)

<BR>

The initial sky color is also set when creating the scene in the initGame function in game.js:
<BR>
javascriptCopyscene.background = new THREE.Color(0x87CEEB); // Sky blue
<BR>
These color and fog effects combined create the nice atmospheric appearance you've noticed in the game.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
